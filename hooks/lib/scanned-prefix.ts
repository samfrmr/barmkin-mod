// Shows a scanned prefix of an oversize string instead of withholding all of
// it. Used only for tool results that no injection screen covers: the screened
// untrusted surfaces keep withholding at their limit.
//
// Everything shown was scanned exactly as a string under the limit is: the head
// is cut inside a 16 KiB scan window, at a point no secret match crosses in
// either the raw or the scrubbed view, and then redacted by the unchanged
// two-pass redactInEitherView. Nothing past the cut is ever shown, and nothing
// past the window is ever matched.
//
// A cut is safe when it
//  - is a line boundary or, failing that, a delimiter (a long single line);
//  - is crossed by no rule match in the raw view or in the scrubbed view;
//  - does not follow a PEM private-key header that nothing closes;
//  - scrubs identically in the head and in the window, so no escape sequence or
//    variation-selector run is split;
//  - is not inside the window's last whitespace-free token. Every rule except
//    the PEM block matches within a token (plus the blanks around an `=` or the
//    whitespace after `Bearer`), and a match that needs text past the window
//    cannot be seen from inside it. Keeping the cut before the last token means
//    a value cut off by the window end is never shown.
// If no cut qualifies the caller withholds, as before.
